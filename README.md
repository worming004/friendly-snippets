# Consider taking a look on original repo

This repo is a contains a collection of snippet I use for neovim. It is intended to match my personal wants, but from a solid based proposed by https://github.com/rafamadriz/friendly-snippets. I do not intend to merge PR as the purpose is not to get a collection of generic snippets.

If you are searching for an open source collection of snippets, accepting PRs, consider the original one.
